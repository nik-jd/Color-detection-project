# Color-detection-project


As we all know that colors are made up of three primary colors: Red, Green, and Blue. 
Their intensities can be measured between 0 to 255 and by combining them we get 6 million different color values. 

This idea of this project is to get the name of the color from the color values. 
To implement this we use a dataset that has color values and labeled colour names, then we calculate the shortest distance between each colour and 
display the colour name that has the shortest distance.
